        "#**The Clarke Transformation: A Quick Recap**\n",
        "\n",
        "First, remember the purpose of the Clarke transformation: It converts three-phase quantities (like currents `ia`, `ib`, `ic` or voltages `va`, `vb`, `vc`) from a stationary reference frame tied to the physical phases into two-phase orthogonal quantities (`iα`, `iβ` or `vα`, `vβ`) in a stationary reference frame aligned with the 'a' phase axis. A zero-sequence component (`i0` or `v0`) is often included to handle unbalanced systems or non-sinusoidal waveforms.\n",
        "\n",
        "The core idea is to simplify the analysis and control of three-phase systems by reducing the number of variables from three coupled ones to two (mostly) independent ones (α and β).\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Key Difference: What Quantity is Preserved**\n",
        "\n",
        "The difference between the \"power-invariant\" and \"amplitude-invariant\" versions lies in **which quantity remains the same** after the transformation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Amplitude-Invariant Clarke Transformation:**\n",
        "    *   **Goal:** To ensure that the **peak amplitude** of the resulting αβ space vector magnitude (`sqrt(α² + β²)`) is equal to the peak amplitude of the original balanced three-phase quantities.\n",
        "    *   **How:** This is achieved by using a scaling factor of **2/3** in the transformation matrix.\n",
        "    *   **Transformation Matrix (Currents):**\n",
        "        ```\n",
        "        [ iα ] = 2/3 * [ 1  -1/2  -1/2 ] [ ia ]\n",
        "        [ iβ ] = 2/3 * [ 0  √3/2 -√3/2 ] [ ib ]\n",
        "        [ i0 ] = 1/3 * [ 1    1     1   ] [ ic ]  // Note: Sometimes different scaling is used for i0\n",
        "        ```\n",
        "    *   **Implication:** If you have balanced phase currents `ia = Ipeak * cos(ωt)`, `ib = Ipeak * cos(ωt - 2π/3)`, `ic = Ipeak * cos(ωt + 2π/3)`, then the magnitude of the transformed vector `sqrt(iα² + iβ²) = Ipeak`. This is intuitive for visualizing the magnitude relative to phase peaks.\n",
        "    *   **Power Calculation:** The instantaneous power calculated using the transformed quantities needs a scaling factor: `P = (3/2) * (vα*iα + vβ*iβ) + v0*i0`. This must equal the original `P = va*ia + vb*ib + vc*ic`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Power-Invariant Clarke Transformation:**\n",
        "    *   **Goal:** To ensure that the **instantaneous power** calculated using the transformed αβ0 quantities is equal to the instantaneous power calculated using the original abc phase quantities, *without* needing an extra scaling factor.\n",
        "    *   **How:** This is achieved by using a scaling factor of **sqrt(2/3)** in the transformation matrix.\n",
        "    *   **Transformation Matrix (Currents):**\n",
        "        ```\n",
        "        [ iα ] = sqrt(2/3) * [ 1  -1/2  -1/2 ] [ ia ]\n",
        "        [ iβ ] = sqrt(2/3) * [ 0  √3/2 -√3/2 ] [ ib ]\n",
        "        [ i0 ] = sqrt(1/3) * [ 1    1     1   ] [ ic ] // Note: Consistent scaling for power invariance\n",
        "        ```\n",
        "    *   **Implication:** The magnitude of the transformed vector `sqrt(iα² + iβ²) = sqrt(3/2) * Ipeak`. The amplitude is scaled compared to the original phase peak.\n",
        "    *   **Power Calculation:** The instantaneous power calculation is direct: `P = vα*iα + vβ*iβ + v0*i0`. This equals the original `P = va*ia + vb*ib + vc*ic`. This form often simplifies subsequent power and torque equations, especially when combined with the Park transformation.\n",
